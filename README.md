## Hosting your own copy of RPG Ambience
If you want full control over the application, or if `rpg-ambience.com` ever goes offline, you can host your own copy of the application. As of November 2015, here's how you do it:

- Download the [latest source files](https://github.com/JakobKallin/RPG-Ambience/archive/gh-pages.zip), in the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/JakobKallin/RPG-Ambience/tree/gh-pages).
- Create a Google account (or use your existing account) and enable the Google Drive API and the Google Drive SDK.
- Make the following modifications to [`source/GoogleDriveBackend.js`](https://github.com/JakobKallin/RPG-Ambience/blob/gh-pages/source/GoogleDriveBackend.js):
  - Replace `907013371139` with the app ID from your Google Drive API settings.
  - Replace `AIzaSyCTT934cGu2bDRbCUdx1bHS8PKT5tE34WM` with the API key from your Google Drive API settings.
- Serve the files using a standard web server like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [Lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/), or with a service like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Add your server's hostname (possibly `localhost`) to the list of authorized JavaScript origins for your Google Drive API settings.

After following these steps, your copy of RPG Ambience should work just like the official one.
