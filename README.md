## What RPG Ambience is
RPG Ambience is a media player that enables roleplayers to bring their sessions to life using sound and visuals. It is free software that runs directly in your browser.

To try it out, visit [the project's official website](http://rpg-ambience.com/).

## How RPG Ambience works
RPG Ambience is built around **scenes**. Scenes are made up of images, sounds, and text grouped together in any combination. Scenes are played and stopped using keyboard shortcuts. Scenes are organized under **adventures**.

The interface of RPG Ambience consists of two parts: the editor and the stage.

- **The editor** (the left half of the screen) contains your adventures and the scenes in them, including controls to edit them.
- **The stage** (the right half of the screen) is where the scenes in your adventures are played.

## Playing scenes
There are three ways to play a scene:

- Press the hotkey associated with the scene.
- Type the scene's name and press **Enter**.
- Press the **Play** button in the top-right corner of the editor.
	
When starting a scene by typing its name, it's enough to type only the first few letters of the name.

## Stopping scenes
There are two ways to stop a scene:

- Press **Enter**.
- Press the **Stop** button in the top-right corner of the editor.

Using either of these commands will only stop the topmost scene that is currently playing. To also stop the scene below it, use the command again.

## Saving adventures
All of the adventures that you create, including the sound and image files that you add to them, are automatically saved whenever you exit RPG Ambience and will appear the next time that you start the application.

## Deleting adventures
To delete an adventure, select the adventure in the drop-down menu and then press **Delete Adventure**. The adventure will be deleted when you exit RPG Ambience. Until then, you can recover the adventure by selecting it again and pressing **Recover Adventure** (which has now replaced **Delete Adventure**).

## Privacy
RPG Ambience runs entirely within your browser; once the application has loaded, no more data is transferred between your computer and the server. All of your adventures are saved right inside your browser. This means that you are in complete control of everything in them, including sound and image files.
