# RPG Ambience

*Bring your game to life with music and visuals*

RPG Ambience is a media player that enables roleplayers to bring their sessions to life using sound and visuals. It is free software that runs directly in your browser.

For instructions on how to use RPG Ambience, consult the help document inside the application.

## Hosting your own copy of RPG Ambience
If you want full control over the application, or if [`app.rpg-ambience.com`](http://app.rpg-ambience.com/) ever goes offline, you can host your own copy of the application. As of August 2018, here's how you do it:

- Download the [latest deployed source files in the `live` folder](https://github.com/JakobKallin/RPG-Ambience/tree/master/live). The other source files in the repo, including those in other branches, may not be up-to-date with the latest version of RPG Ambience actually deployed.
- Create a Google account (or use your existing account) and enable the Google Drive API and the Google Drive SDK in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
- Make the following modifications to [`source/GoogleDriveBackend.js`](https://github.com/JakobKallin/RPG-Ambience/blob/gh-pages/source/GoogleDriveBackend.js):
  - Replace `907013371139` with the app ID from your Google Drive API settings.
  - Replace `AIzaSyCTT934cGu2bDRbCUdx1bHS8PKT5tE34WM` with the API key from your Google Drive API settings.
- Serve the files using a standard web server like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [Lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/), or with a service like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Add your server's hostname (possibly `localhost`) to the list of authorized JavaScript origins in your Google Drive API settings.

After following these steps, your copy of RPG Ambience should work just like the official one, only with a different account providing the Google Drive integration.

*I have not tested the steps above and may have missed some step. If the instructions don't work for you, please let me know.*
